Hello!
snake is now available as an app (snake.exe(windows) and snake(linux), if you use chromeos, then I am sorry, but there is no executable file type for chromeos)

NO ADMIN RIGHTS ARE REQUIRED FOR THE APP'S USE This means that it can be run on the surfaces
When downloading the app, you will probably get a lot of popups telling you it is a virus, click install or run anyway
(often you have to click the 3 dots or learn more to get that option)
you probably won't get as many popups for linux
I know that this works on ubuntu, but I don't know whether it will run on other distros
Enjoy!
